Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

The Weekend Salary Update project has an HTML, CSS, and JS files. 
The files all work together to create a form that takes in an employees:

First name
Last name
ID Number
Job Title
Annual Salary

Once the employee fills out there info and submits the form, their infor will be pushed to the DOM so that it may display on the page. We can add as many employees as we want and each will be displayed on the DOM.

If there is an employee that we would like to remove we may do so by clicking the delete button. 

We also have a section called the Total Monthly Cost, where it will add up the cost of each emplyees salary for that month and display it on the page. Please note that when the salary total is more that $20000, the total monthly cost line will change to a red background.
